  [ James Henstridge ]
  * Make providers exit after 30 seconds of inactivity. (LP: #1616758)
  * Add UnauthorizedException to the provider library, so the provider
    can trigger reauthentication of the account and have the request
    restarted. (LP: #1616756)
  * Dynamically add and remove providers as the associated accounts
    are enabled and disabled. (LP: #1616757)
  * Allow creation of storage providers that don't use online-accounts.
    Thisis likely only of interest to the local storage provider.

  [ Michi Henning ]
  * Add a storage provider backed by the local file system.
  * Move unity::storage::provider::Item to its own header file. (LP:
    #1668872)
  * If a provider can't acquire its D-Bus well known name, exit rather
    than throwing a (usually uncaught) exception. (LP: #1604640)
