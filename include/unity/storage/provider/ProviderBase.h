\brief Abstract base class for provider implementations.

The runtime calls methods on this class in response to incoming requests from clients. Each method
implements a specific operation on the storage backend.

All methods are called from the main thread and must not block. Methods indicate error conditions to the runtime
by throwing exceptions (which are caught and handled by the runtime). Alternatively, methods can return a future
that stores an exception to indicate an error.

\note Besides the explicitly listed exceptions for specific error conditions, all methods
must indicate other errors by throwing an exception derived from StorageException, such
as PermissionException or ResourceException (see <a href="index.html#provider-error-handling">Error Handling</a>).
If an exception that does not derive from StorageException is thrown a provider method, the runtime returns a
generic UnknownException to the client.
